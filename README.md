# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
In this task, I was tasked with using a range of machine learning algorithms to train and test off a dataset and then use the data to assess which algorithm was the most effective. I used several popular algorithms including Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector Machines. I preprocessed the dataset and then split it into training and testing sets. I trained each algorithm on the training set and then evaluated their performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. After comparing the results, I was able to determine that the Random Forest algorithm performed the best on the dataset, with the highest accuracy and lowest error rate. This task allowed me to gain hands-on experience with different machine learning algorithms and understand their strengths and weaknesses, as well as how to evaluate their performance.
